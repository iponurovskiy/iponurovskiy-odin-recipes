    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pad Thai is a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly served as a street food
        in Thailand as part of the country's cuisine.
        It is typically made with rice noodles, shrimp, peanuts,
        a scrambled egg, and bean sprouts, among other vegetables. 
        The ingredients are fried in a wok. Once the dish is completed it 
        is tossed in pad thai sauce, which gives the dish its signature tangy
        salty flavor with a hint of sweetness.
