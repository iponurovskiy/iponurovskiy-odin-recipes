    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Massaman Curry is a bit of an outlier in Thai cuisine. 
        It was born from Indian and Malay influences and as a result, 
        the main flavours comes from spices typically associated with 
        Indian curries. Spices such as: cumin, coriander, cloves, 
        nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamom.
    </p>

    <p>Basically, if you take Indian curry spices and do a mash up
         with aromatics used in Thai curries (garlic, lemongrass, galangal),
          add coconut and peanuts, you end up with Massaman Curry. 
          So it tastes like a mash up between an Indian curry and Thai Curry.
