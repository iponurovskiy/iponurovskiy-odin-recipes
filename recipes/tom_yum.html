    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>One of the most famous of all Thai foods, 
        and what I think is one the best soups in the world,
        is Thai tom yum goong.
    </p>

    <p>The words "tom yam" are derived from two Thai words.
        Tom refers to the boiling process, while yam means 'mixed'.
        Tom yum is characterised by its distinct hot and sour flavours, 
        with fragrant spices and herbs generously used in the broth. 
        The soup is also made with fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, 
        kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, 
        and crushed red chili peppers. 
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the shrimp and remove the heads.
             Reserve the meat and the shells separately.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in your wok over medium high heat,
             and add the shrimp shells and heads.</li>
        <li>Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, until they turn a bright and deep orange.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cups of water, and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. 
            Remove the shells from the stock using a strainer.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock</li>
        <li>Take the lemongrass, and trim away the dry reedy bit about 
            halfway up the stalk, and then trim the base. 
            Peel the tough outer layers away to reveal the more tender center. 
            Smash the lemon grass using a mallet or heavy rolling pin (one without handles). </li>
        <li>Cut the smashed lemongrass stalk into 2-inch (5 cm) lengths, 
            and add it to the broth in the wok. 
            Also add the shallots, cilantro stem, galangal, lime leaves, and thai chilies. </li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. 
            After 10 minutes, you can remove the inedible herbs and aromatics 
            from the pot using a fine-meshed strainer. 
            However, we like to leave them in, as is traditional in Thailand.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms, and simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sugar, Thai chili paste and fish sauce. 
            Stir until the chili paste has fully dissolved in the soup. </li>
        <li>Finally, add the shrimp. Simmer for 30 seconds to 1 minute, 
            depending on their size, until they’re just cooked through. </li>
        <li>Add the lime juice to your serving bowl, 
            and ladle the hot tom yum soup into the bowl. 
            (You don’t want to cook the lime juice, but preserve its fresh flavor. 
            You also want to avoid putting large amounts of acidic lime juice into your wok,
             which can wear away the patina).</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
